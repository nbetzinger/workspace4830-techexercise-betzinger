	<h1>About This Application</h1>
	
	<p>This application allows you to insert tasks with a given due date, set by yourself in a uniform format, with a given priority of 1-5. 1 is top priority, while 5 is not a priority at all.
	Along with this, you are allowed to name the task, so that a small description is given as to what the task is for or about. You are able to search tasks by the due date, which will list all tasks on a date,
	or see all of your tasks in a large list. The purpose is to have a visual organization of tasks. You may also remove a task, if wished, through the viewing page.</p>
